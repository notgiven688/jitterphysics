Jitter Physics is a fast and lightweight 3D physics engine written in C#.

**Platforms & Frameworks**
 - Every platform which supports .NET, Mono or Xamarin
 - Works with the Mono framework on Linux/Mac without any recompilation 
 - Also supports the Xbox360 and Windows Phone _(up to v0.1.7)_
 - No dependencies. Works with every 3D engine/framework. 

**Overall Design** 
 - Written in pure C# with a clean and object orientated API 
 - Optimized for low to no garbage collections and maximum speed 
 - Supported Shapes: TriangleMesh, Terrain, Compound, MinkowskiSum, Box, Sphere, 
   Cylinder, Cone, Capsule, ConvexHull 
 - Take advantage of multi-core CPUs by using the internal multithreading of 
   the engine 

## Jitter Physics (2D)

The ["Jitter-2D" branch][jitter2d] is still in development an is not complete.
At this time, it is probably better to make use of [Farseer Physics][farseer].

## Quick Start

### Initialize the Physics System
Create a world class and initialize it with a `CollisionSystem`:

    CollisionSystem collision = new CollisionSystemSAP();
    World world = new World(collision);

### Add Objects to the World
Create a shape of your choice and pass it to a body:

    Shape shape = new BoxShape(1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f);
    RigidBody body = new RigidBody(shape);

It's valid to use the same shape for different bodies. 
Set the position and orientation of the body by using it's properties. 
The next step is to add the `Body` to the world:
 
    world.AddBody(body);
 
### Run the Simulation
Now you can call the `Step` method to integrate the world one timestep further. 
This should be done in you main game loop:
 
    while (gameRunning)
    {
        world.Step(1.0f / 100.0f, true);
        
        // do other stuff, like drawing
    }
 
The first parameter is the timestep. This value should be as small as possible 
to get a stable simulation. The second parameter is for whether using internal 
multithreading or not. That's it the body is now simulated and affected by 
default gravity specified in `World.Gravity`. After each timestep the `Position` 
of the body should be different.
